Describe yourself in two to three sentences.
I've spent much of my life learning (I have a BA, two Master's in very different disciplines and a teaching certification) and have never loved learning about something as much as web development. Like many people, I'm a quick learner when I'm interested in the subject and not so much when I'm not. My wife and I recently returned to the states from a year teaching English in Korea and had a wonderful time, but are really enjoying being back home and being able to see family and friends. 
What's important to you?
I like learning and developing skills and I really enjoy solving problems. I especially like helping others solve problems. It's important for me to always be working on growing as an individual and bettering myself in some way. I like setting goals and working my ass off to achieve them.
Where are you from?
Fort Worth, Texas.
What are your favorite hobbies?
Lately my hobby has been learning about development, but I also watch Shark Tank and the Real Housewives with my wife (She recently got me into it. I refused to watch it for years.), and love to visit new restaurants and try new recipies when I have the time. I'm also a big RPG fan and spent god knows how much time playing the Witcher 3 and have yet to complete it.

What's your dream job?
I would love to be a front end developer. I enjoy being able to see the work that I've done on the screen and style something perfectly. I enjoy the logical side of programming, but also have always had a love of using my creative side to make things that are fun and interesting, even if just for me.
What music have you been listening to lately?
When I'm working on a project, I listen to the Neutral Milk Hotel Pandora station which tends to play a lot of Decemberists, Modest Mouse and Mountain Goats. When I'm reading or studying, I like to listen to classical or instrumental music.
