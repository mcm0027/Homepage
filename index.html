			  <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
			  <p>Hey, I'm Matt Morris, and I am working toward being a professional web developer. I've spent much of my life learning (I have a BA, two Master's in very different disciplines and a teaching certification) and have <em>never</em> loved learning about something as much as web development.</p>
			  <p>My wife and I recently returned to the states from a year teaching English in Korea and had a wonderful time, but are really enjoying being back home and being able to see family and friends in person instead of on Skype.</p>
			  <p>I like learning and developing skills and I really enjoy solving problems. I especially like helping others solve problems. It's important for me to always be working on growing as an individual and bettering myself in some way. I like setting goals and working my ass off to achieve them.</p>

		  <h2><strong>Where I'm From</strong></h2>
		  <p>I'm from Fort Worth, Texas, but wouldn't consider myself a stereotypical Texan. Many of the people I met in Korea were surprised that I didn't have a southern accent. I don't own a horse or a cowboy hat, but I do have a nice pair of python skin boots for special occasions.</p>
		  <p>One of the best things about living in the South is our diverse population and the number of cultures represented when you get into the cities like Dallas or Houston. You never have to go far to find authentic Mexican food, and Dallas even has two great Korean communities I can stop by when I need a kimchi fix.</p>

		  <h2><strong>More About Me</strong></h2>
		  <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
		  <p>Lately my main hobby has been learning about development, but I also watch Shark Tank and the Real Housewives with my wife (She recently got me into it. I refused to watch it for years.), and love to visit new restaurants and try new recipies when I have the time. I'm also a big RPG fan and spent god knows how much time playing <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> and have yet to complete it.</p>
		  <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
		  <p>I would love to be a front end developer. I enjoy being able to see the work that I've done on the screen and style something perfectly. I enjoy the logical side of programming, but also have always had a love of using my creative side to make things that are fun and interesting, even if just for me.</p>
		  <h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
		  <p>When I'm working on a project, I listen to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7BqHYM-VJA">Neutral Milk Hotel</a> Pandora station which tends to play a lot of 
		   The Decemberists, Modest Mouse, Bright Eyes and The Mountain Goats, which works out, because those are some of my favorite bands.</p>
		  <p> When I'm reading or studying, I can't really concentrate with most music, so like to listen to classical or instrumental music.</p>
